# CodingEventsJava

//The first should describe the purpose of the app. 

Coding Events is an app to share events related to coding. 


//The second should describe the current state of the app. 

Currently, events can be added with a type, description and contact email. Events can also be deleted. New types of events can also be added. 


//The third and final section should describe the future improvements you want to make to the app including your notes about the Person class.

In the future, a user section will allow users to sign in and save events that interest them. 
Code preview: add a person class with primary, generated integer id, string username, string password and list of saved events.
The class will need methods to get & set all but the id. Also needed will be methods to add to, delete from and view the saved events list.
Events & Person will have a many-to-many relationship.
